              <p>
                I never thought I&apos;d agree to a fake marriage, especially not with Noah, my ex-boyfriends billionaire brother. But when my financial situation took a turn for the worse, I had no choice. Noah was the CEO of the company where I
                worked, and he offered me financial security in exchange for a fake marriage. He was the sunshine and I was damaged and grumpy, but we were stuck with each other. As we spent more time together, I began to see Noah in a new light.
                Despite our differences, we began to develop feelings for each other. Just when things were going exceptionally, a whirlwind of obstacles made its way to us, including the arrival of my ex- boyfriend, Noah&apos;s jealous
                ex-girlfriend, and *drumroll* A surprise pregnancy! Will Noah and I be able to face these challenges and will our love for each other continue to grow?
